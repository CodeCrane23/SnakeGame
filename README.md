# SnakeGame
Made the classic nokia snake game using the turtle module in python.
Turtle Graphics is used to setup the GUI.
The project is divided into various modules each controlling an individual element. The main file then imports all the other modules and runs the main game loop.
I have also added a high score feature which keeps track of the highest score and stores it into a txt file.Every time the high score gets beaten the data in the txt file gets updated.
